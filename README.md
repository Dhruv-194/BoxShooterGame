# BoxShooterGame

A 3-D box shooter game created using Unity Game Engine and build it for the WebGL platform. 

This game is inspired by the famous AimLabs Training Program which you can find on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/714010/Aim_Lab/). 

The game is under development and I will be adding more stuff to the game and push the changes to this repository in the future.
