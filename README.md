# BoxShooterGame

A 3-D first person, box shooter game created using Unity Game Engine and build it for the WebGL platform. 

This game is inspired by the famous AimLabs Training Program which you can find on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/714010/Aim_Lab/). 

The game is under development and I will be adding more stuff to the game and push the changes to this repository in the future.
